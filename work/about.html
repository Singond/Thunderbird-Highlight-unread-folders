		This add-on enables highlighting the account names which contain unread messages.
	</p>
	<p>
		Normally, a folder and its parent account name will flash briefly
		to indicate it contains new mail.
		(Please note the difference between <em>new mail</em> and <em>unread mail</em>.)
		After a while, this highlight disappears, leaving the folder marked in bold,
		but dropping any indication on the account name completely.
		This can be a nuisance for collapsed accounts,
		as it makes it easy to overlook unread mail.
	</p>
	<p>
		This add-on attempts to solve that by keeping the folders and accounts
		highlighted even if they contain <em>unread</em> mail, but no <em>new</em> mail.
		Highlighting folders and account names can be toggled separately
		in the add-on options dialog.
	</p>
	<p>
		The functionality is achieved by enabling the account name object
		to receive the <code>hasUnreadMessages-true</code> property.
		Also, the regular folders receive additional <code>isServer-false</code>property,
		in order to distinguish them from account names easily in CSS.
	</p>
	<p>
		Currently, there are two options for either account names or folder names:
	</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Use the default Thunderbird style</li>
			<li>Use the blue highlight which is seen on new mail.
				(This uses <code>color: -moz-hyperlinktext;</code> CSS
				and is subject to change if you mess with the variable.</li>
		</ol>
	<p>
		Further customization is possible via userChrome.css. In the CSS use the selectors
		<code>treechildren::-moz-tree-cell-text(hasUnreadMessages-true, isServer-false)</code>
		for regular folders, and
		<code>treechildren::-moz-tree-cell-text(hasUnreadMessages-true, isServer-true)</code>
		for account names.
